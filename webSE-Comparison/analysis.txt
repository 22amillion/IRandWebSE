Based on the analysis of 100 queries, DuckDuckGo demonstrates substantial divergence from Google in search results and rankings. The average percent overlap is 17.9%, indicating that DuckDuckGo and Google share relatively few common results in their top 10 rankings. This suggests that DuckDuckGo often provides distinct search results compared to Google. The average Spearman coefficient of -6.28 indicates a strong negative correlation in the ranking of shared results. This suggests that when DuckDuckGo and Google return the same results, they tend to rank them differently. Overall, these data indicate that DuckDuckGo performed worse than Google, offering users a notably different set of search results and rankings. This difference could be attributed to varying algorithms, indexing methods, or potentially DuckDuckGo's focus on privacy.
